Logistic regression ORs and predicted values, come onn  

<!--more-->

This really basic concept ALWAYS confuses me, and it's got to stop once and for all plzz. 

Suppose the following logistic regression model (from UCLA biostats website): 
```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
model <- glm(formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data=mydata, family=binomial)
summary(model)
```
And the following odds ratios:
```{r}
exp(coef(model))
```

For GPA (for instance), a one unit increase in GPA, e.g. from 2.0 to 3.0, makes you more than twice as likely to be admitted to a university. This assumes other variables are held at a constant value (mean).  

NOW - suppose you calculate predicted log-odds for a set of data values - GPA 2 vs 3, all other variables held at their means:
```{r}

values <- data.frame(gre = rep(mean(mydata$gre), 2), 
                     gpa = c(2,3), 
                     rank = rep(mean(mydata$rank, 2)))

predict(model, values, type = 'link')

```

The numbers above correspond to the predicted log-odds of GPA 2.0 vs 3.0, all else being equal. If we exponentiate, you calculate odds:

```{r}

exp(predict(model, values, type = 'link'))
```

And finally, you can take the ratio of the odds to get .... the odds-ratio:
```{r}
0.4104872 / 0.1887326
```


What always confuses me is the prediction of log-odds using `predict` vs being to calculate odds ratios directly by exponentiating the linear combination of parameters. I think my short circuit is often thinking that exponentiating the predicted log-odds means you get odds ratios for the combination of parameters. That's not the case, since it's NOT A RATIO..
